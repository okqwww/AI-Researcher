\subsection{Variational Autoencoders and Discrete Representation Learning}
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have become a prominent framework for generative modeling, particularly in the realm of discrete latent representations. The foundational work of \cite{NEURIPS2017_1711.00937} introduces the Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) architecture, which implements vector quantization to derive discrete embeddings. This architecture enhances generative capabilities and interpretability by mapping continuous representations to a discrete codebook, addressing the issue of posterior collapse commonly encountered in traditional VAEs.

Following the introduction of the VQ-VAE, various extensions and adaptations have emerged, further expanding the VAE framework. For instance, Botta's exploration of Gaussian Mixture VAEs \cite{GaussianMixtureVAE} integrates categorical latent variables to model complex data distributions as a mixture of Gaussians. This hierarchical approach allows for flexible encoding of diverse datasets such as images and time series into structured latent spaces.

A notable technical advancement within the VAE framework is the Gumbel-Softmax trick \cite{CategoricalReparameterization}, which provides a differentiable method for sampling from categorical distributions. This approach resolves the non-differentiability issues associated with discrete variables, enabling gradient-based optimization. By using this reparameterization trick, the categorical distribution can be smoothly approximated, which is instrumental for the training of models with discrete latents.

Despite the successes associated with these methodologies, challenges remain in the optimization and interpretability of the latent space. High-dimensional data or intricate mixture distributions can lead to convergence issues during training, necessitating careful tuning of model parameters and thoughtful implementation of training strategies to achieve robust performance.

The relevance of these methodologies to the proposed work lies in their integration within diffusion models. By leveraging VQ-VAEs for effective representation learning, our approach aims to enhance the quality and diversity of generated outputs. This synergistic approach combines the strengths of discrete representation learning with diffusion-based generation, addressing the evolving demands of generative modeling.

In summary, the chronological development of discrete representation learning through VAEs showcases the maturation of the field from foundational VQ-VAEs to sophisticated extensions incorporating categorical variables and efficient sampling techniques. While significant advances have been made, ongoing challenges present opportunities for further exploration and improvement in generative modeling frameworks.
