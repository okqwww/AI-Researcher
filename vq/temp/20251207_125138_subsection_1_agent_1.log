\subsection{Latent Diffusion Models}

Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) signify a notable progress in the landscape of generative modeling, particularly for high-resolution image synthesis. The foundational paper \emph{High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models} by Rombach et al. \cite{rombach2021highresolution} introduced a compelling architecture that marries latent representation learning with diffusion processes. These models effectively compress high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional latent spaces, enabling the generation of high-quality images while optimizing computational efficiency.

LDMs build on essential concepts from variational autoencoders (VAEs) and discrete representation learning \cite{neural_discrete_representation_learning}. They utilize a two-step process—encoding and decoding—to effectively manage latent representations. The key innovation of LDMs lies in their capacity to perform diffusion within the latent space as opposed to the pixel space, which enhances both sampling efficiency and the quality of the generated images by facilitating more manageable noise reduction in these lower-dimensional representations.

The implementation of LDMs by Stability AI, particularly through their Stable Diffusion framework \cite{stability_ai_stablediffusion}, further illustrates the versatility of these models across diverse creative tasks, such as text-to-image synthesis and image inpainting. Their adaptability has permitted integration into a wide array of applications, emphasizing their potential beyond conventional image generation tasks.

Despite these advancements, there remain challenges associated with scaling LDMs and minimizing artifacts during the sampling process. As LDMs are scaled to generate increasingly complex images, ensuring diversity in the generative outputs while concurrently mitigating artifacts presents significant difficulties. Additionally, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms governing trade-offs between reconstruction and generation quality is imperative.

The connection of LDMs to the proposed work is underscored by their effective utilization of latent representations to enhance synthesis quality. By leveraging LDMs in conjunction with existing methodologies, such as those developed in the context of variational and discrete representation learning \cite{edoardo_botta_gmvae, kohonen_vae}, the proposed approach aims not only to address current limitations but also to advance the capabilities of generative models.
