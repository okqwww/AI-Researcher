In this work, we addressed the challenges associated with gradient propagation in Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) by proposing an Enhanced VQ-VAE architecture. The integration of a Rotation and Rescaling Transform (RRT) represents a significant technical innovation aimed at improving gradient flow through quantization layers, ultimately enhancing the model's capacity for high-fidelity image generation. Our experimental results demonstrated notable improvements in reconstruction loss, PSNR, and SSIM, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed enhancements.

Looking ahead, several avenues for future work arise from this research. Further optimization of codebook utilization strategies and the exploration of alternative rotational methods could yield additional improvements in generative performance. Additionally, incorporating perceptual losses may enhance the perceptual quality of generated images while addressing the observed challenges related to FID scores. These efforts will contribute to a deeper understanding of the interplay between gradient flow and representation quality, paving the way for new research directions within generative modeling frameworks.
