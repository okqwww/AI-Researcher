\section{Methodology Overview}
The proposed method presents an innovative Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) architecture augmented by a Rotation-Rescaling Transform (RRT). The primary objective is to enhance gradient propagation through quantization layers, thereby improving both representation capabilities and reconstruction fidelity.

\subsection{Latent Representation Encoder}
The Encoder is pivotal to this framework, tasked with transforming raw images into compact latent representations optimized for quantization. By effectively extracting significant features, the Encoder contributes to the overall performance and efficiency of the model, yielding latent representations essential for subsequent processing.

\textbf{Input:} Raw images ($x$);  
\textbf{Output:} Latent representations ($z_e$).

\textbf{Workflow:}  
\[
    x \xrightarrow{\text{Encoder}} z_e
\]

\subsubsection{Encoder Architecture}
The Encoder employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to systematically extract hierarchical spatial features from input images. Key components include:

1. **Convolutional Layers**: The initial segment consists of multiple convolutional layers that execute successive convolutions, effectively capturing complex spatial patterns while downsampling and augmenting the depth of feature maps. Each layer's transformation can be mathematically described as:

   \[
   z_1 = \text{ReLU}(\text{Conv2D}(x)),
   \]
   
   where \(z_1\) denotes the feature maps produced by the initial convolutional layer.

   \textbf{Input:} Raw images ($x$);  
   \textbf{Output:} Feature maps ($h$).  

   \textbf{Workflow:}  
   \[
   x \xrightarrow{\text{Convolutional Layers}} h
   \]

2. **Residual Stack**: To address gradient propagation challenges in deeper networks, the Encoder integrates a Residual Stack that employs skip connections, enhancing gradient flow. This is mathematically represented as:

   \[
   z_e = h + F(h),
   \]

   where \(F(h)\) pertains to the residual block transformations.

   \textbf{Input:} Feature maps ($h$);  
   \textbf{Output:} Enhanced latent representations ($z_e$).  

   \textbf{Workflow:}  
   \[
   h \xrightarrow{\text{Residual Stack}} z_e
   \]

3. **Gumbel-Softmax Sampling**: To facilitate smooth gradient propagation during training, the Encoder utilizes Gumbel-Softmax sampling, defined as:

   \[
   y = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{\text{logits} + gumbel}{\text{temperature}}\right),
   \]
   
   where \(gumbel\) is sampled from a Gumbel distribution.

The Encoder effectively establishes a foundation for the quantization process through this structured pipeline, leveraging hierarchical convolutional layers, residual connections, and advanced sampling techniques.

\subsection{Vector Quantization Mechanism}
The Vector Quantizer (VQ) component performs the critical function of discretizing continuous latent representations into distinct embeddings. This operation enables the model to efficiently encode learned features, enhancing its capacity for structured representation, essential in generative tasks.

\subsubsection{Quantization Process}
During the forward pass, the Vector Quantizer processes latent representations \( z_e \) and generates quantized outputs \( z_q \) while calculating the quantization loss, represented mathematically as:

\begin{equation}
z_e \xrightarrow{\text{Quantizer}} z_q, \quad \text{vq\_loss}, \quad \text{stats}
\end{equation}

Here, \( \text{vq\_loss} \), encompassing commitment and codebook losses, ensures training stability, while \( \text{stats} \) provides insights into feature utilization.

\subsubsection{Embedding Updates via EMA}
The quantization leverages an adaptive codebook where embedding updates occur via an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) approach, defined as:

\begin{equation}
\text{Updated Embeddings} \leftarrow \text{EMA}(z_e, \text{encoding indices})
\end{equation}

This dynamic contributes to and aligns with the latent space distribution, optimizing feature capture.

\subsubsection{Gradient Transformation through RRT}
To mitigate non-differentiability in quantization, the Rotation-Rescaling Transform (RRT) is employed, preserving angular relationships during gradient propagation:

\begin{equation}
z_q \xrightarrow{\text{RRT}} \text{Transformed Gradients}
\end{equation}

This method utilizes Householder reflections, ensuring effective gradient backpropagation to the encoder, thereby enhancing training efficiency.

\subsection{High-Fidelity Image Decoder}
The Decoder is designed to reconstruct high-quality images from quantized representations ($z_q$) generated by the Vector Quantizer. By leveraging learned features, it aims to generate outputs that closely match the original input both visually and semantically, essential for generative modeling objectives.

\subsubsection{Decoder Architecture}
The Decoder primarily consists of transposed convolutional layers structured to upscale quantized representations while refining feature maps. The processing sequence can be described as:

\begin{align*}
\text{Input:} & \quad \text{Quantized representations } (z_q) \\
\text{Output:} & \quad \text{Intermediate feature maps for reconstruction } (\hat{h}) \\
\text{Processing:} & \quad z_q \xrightarrow{\text{Transposed Convolutional Layers}} \hat{h}
\end{align*}

To improve gradient propagation, the Decoder incorporates residual connections that alleviate the vanishing gradient problem, ensuring the retention and flow of gradient information throughout the architecture.

\subsubsection{Output Layer Functionality}
The Output Layer synthesizes the intermediate feature maps into final reconstructed images. This step is critical for ensuring fidelity in generated outputs, described as follows:

\begin{align*}
\text{Input:} & \quad \text{Intermediate feature maps } (\hat{h}) \\
\text{Output:} & \quad \text{Final reconstructed images } (\hat{x}) \\
\text{Processing:} & \quad \hat{h} \xrightarrow{\text{Output Layer}} \hat{x}
\end{align*}

In this layer, a sigmoid activation function normalizes pixel values to the range [0, 1], preserving RGB format and enhancing output fidelity.

Additionally, the integration of the Rotation-Rescaling Transform (RRT) in the Decoder boosts gradient flow, preserving angular relationships critical for backpropagation in non-differentiable environments.

In conclusion, the architecture and operations of the proposed VQ-VAE framework, through advanced embedding updates, quantization mechanisms, and a robust decoding process, significantly contribute to the enhancement of generative modeling capabilities, promoting high-fidelity image reconstructions.
