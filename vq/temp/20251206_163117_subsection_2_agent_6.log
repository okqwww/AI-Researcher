\subsection{Decoder}

The decoder in the Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) is instrumental in reconstructing images from the quantized latent representations produced by the vector quantizer. Designed symmetrically to the encoder, the architecture of the decoder is specifically crafted to convert lower-dimensional latent features back into the original image dimensions. This reconstruction process is essential for maintaining the quality and fidelity of the output images, which is achieved through a carefully structured sequence of transposed convolutional layers, supplemented by residual blocks that enhance feature representation.

The decoding process can be delineated into several critical steps: it commences with the input of the quantized latent representations, which are then processed through a series of transposed convolutional layers, allowing for an upscale in spatial dimensions. Following this, the decoder applies residual blocks to refine and enrich the extracted features, culminating in the production of the reconstructed images that align with the original input dimensions. Mathematically, this decoding operation can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{x}_{\text{recon}} = \text{Decoder}(\mathbf{z}_{\text{quant}}),
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{x}_{\text{recon}}$ represents the reconstructed output image, affirming the decoder's competency in recovering intricate details and structural complexities requisite for high-quality image reconstruction.

\subsubsection{Transposed Convolutions}
Transposed convolutions play a fundamental role in the decoder, as they facilitate the progressive transformation of quantized latent representations back to their original spatial dimensions. This operation is vital for the model to learn essential spatial features necessary for effective image reconstruction. The decoding process initiates with an initial transposed convolution, which first expands the dimensions of the latent feature maps. The subsequent layers of transposed convolutions fine-tune these outputs and ensure proper alignment with the target image dimensions.

\textbf{Input:} Quantized latent vectors of size $(D, H', W')$, where $D$ indicates the dimensionality of the latent representations, while $(H', W')$ are the spatial dimensions of the feature maps. \\
\textbf{Output:} Intermediate feature maps of size $(C, H, W)$, with $C$ denoting the number of output channels aimed at reconstructing the final image. \\
\textbf{Workflow:} Quantized Representations $\rightarrow$ Transposed Convolution Operations $\rightarrow$ Upscaled Feature Maps.

\subsubsection{Residual Stack in Decoder}
The decoder incorporates a residual stack, corresponding to the design of the encoder, comprising multiple residual blocks aimed at further enhancing and refining the feature representations accrued during the transposed convolution phase. This architectural strategy improves the feature extraction process and mitigates the degradation challenges typically encountered in deeper networks. Consequently, the final output is ensured to closely mirror the original input images. The architecture utilizes skip connections within the residual blocks, which significantly improve gradient flow, thereby bolstering the model's ability to effectively capture complex and non-linear relationships during the reconstruction process.

\textbf{Input:} Feature maps resulting from the transposed convolution operations, sized $(C, H, W)$. \\
\textbf{Output:} Processed output feature maps of the same size $(C, H, W)$, fully prepared for image representation. \\
\textbf{Workflow:} Input Feature Maps $\rightarrow$ Residual Block Transformations $\rightarrow$ Final Output Feature Maps.

The synergy of transposed convolutions coupled with the residual stack equips the VQ-VAE decoder with a robust mechanism to convert discrete, quantized latent representations back into a continuous pixel space. This architecture not only facilitates high-fidelity reconstructions but also ensures meticulous preservation of subtle details and textures, which significantly enhances the overall efficacy of the VQ-VAE framework. Furthermore, meticulous attention to critical parameters such as codebook size, commitment loss, and training configurations—including the application of an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for codebook updates—contributes collectively to stabilizing the learning process and mitigating codebook collapse over iterations. This comprehensive approach augments both the fidelity and resilience of the outputs generated by the VQ-VAE model.
