\subsection{Variational Autoencoders and Discrete Representation Learning}

Variational autoencoders (VAEs) have become significant generative models in machine learning, especially in the context of discrete representation learning. A foundational contribution in this area is the work by van den Oord et al. (2017), in which they introduced the Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE). This model innovatively integrates vector quantization into the VAE framework to handle discrete latent spaces effectively. The VQ-VAE utilizes a set of discrete embeddings learned from continuous data, which significantly enhances the quality of representations for various generative tasks and allows for the effective modeling of complex data distributions.

Following the introduction of VQ-VAEs, Edoardo Botta proposed further advancements with the Gaussian Mixture VAE, delineated in his paper “Deep Unsupervised Clustering with Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoders.” This model extends the VAE framework by incorporating Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to categorize data distributions, leveraging categorical latent variables for improved representational richness. Notably, the implementation of the Gumbel-softmax reparameterization proved crucial in addressing the optimization challenges associated with discrete latent variables, enabling effective gradient-based optimization in settings that traditionally posed difficulties due to their non-differentiable nature.

The methodologies underlying these models commonly involve the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for optimization and the Gumbel-softmax mechanism to manage discrete representations. The Gumbel-softmax provides a differentiable approach for sampling from categorical distributions, which is foundational for training models through gradient descent methods.

Despite these advancements, the VAE framework still faces significant challenges. Optimization of discrete latent spaces remains problematic, and there is a pressing need for greater interpretability of the latent representations. Issues such as posterior collapse and mode degradation continue to plague traditional VAE implementations, often leading to reduced generative performance and inefficient representations.

This body of work is directly relevant to our proposed methods, which aim to integrate the principles developed in VQ-VAEs with diffusion models. By incorporating discrete representations into our framework, we seek to enhance both the efficiency and quality of data generation processes. Our approach draws upon the successes of prior innovations while addressing the ongoing challenges in representation learning.
