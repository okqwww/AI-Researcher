The output from the Encoder serves as the input for the Vector Quantizer.\n%\n% Input: Raw images ($x$);\n% Output: Latent representations ($z_e$).\n%\n% Workflow: \n% Raw image $x \\xrightarrow{\\text{Encoder}} z_e$.\n\n\\subsubsection{Convolutional Layers}\n% These layers progressively extract spatial hierarchies from the input images, facilitating the model's ability to learn detailed feature maps essential for subsequent layers.\n%\n% Input: Raw images ($x$);\n% Output: Feature maps ($h$).\n%\n% Workflow: \n% Raw image $x \\xrightarrow{\\text{Convolutional Layers}} h$.\n\n\\subsubsection{Residual Stack}\n% The Residual Stack leverages skip connections to enhance gradient flow in deeper layers, improving the quality of the latent representations produced.\n%\n% Input: Feature maps ($h$);\n% Output: Enhanced latent representations ($z_e$).\n%\n% Workflow: \n% Feature maps $h \\xrightarrow{\\text{Residual Stack}} z_e$.\n\n\\subsection{Vector Quantizer}\n% The Vector Quantizer's primary function is to discretize continuous latent representations into distinct embeddings. \n% It employs Exponential Moving Average (EMA) updates to optimize the training process, contributing to more stable gradient flow during backpropagation.\n%\n% Input: Latent representations ($z_e$);\n% Output: Quantized representations ($z_q$), along with quantization losses and statistics.\n%\n% Workflow: \n% Latent representation $z_e \\xrightarrow{\\text{Quantizer}} z_q, vq\\_loss, stats$.\n\n\\subsubsection{Embedding Updates}\n% This mechanism updates the codebook of embeddings based on usage frequency through EMA techniques, allowing adaptation to input data distribution.\n%\n% Input: Latent representations ($z_e$);\n% Output: Updated embeddings.\n%\n% Workflow: \n% Latent representations $z_e \\xrightarrow{\\text{Embedding Updates}} \\text{Updated Embeddings}$.\n\n\\subsubsection{RRT Gradient Transport}\n% The Rotation-Rescaling Transform (RRT) improves gradient flow across quantization layers by implementing transformations that preserve angles, enabling effective backpropagation of gradients in non-differentiable settings.\n%\n% Input: Quantized representations ($z_q$);\n% Output: Transformed gradients for effective backpropagation.\n%\n% Workflow: \n% Quantized representation $z_q \\xrightarrow{\\text{RRT}} \\text{Transformed Gradients}$.\n\n\\subsection{Decoder}\n% The Decoder is responsible for reconstructing images from the quantized representations, ensuring that outputs closely match the original input data.\n% It acts as the concluding stage in the generative modeling process, leveraging learned latent features to perform high-fidelity reconstructions.\n%\n% Input: Quantized representations ($z_q$);\n% Output: Reconstructed images ($\\hat{x}$).\n%\n% Workflow: \n% Quantized representation $z_q \\xrightarrow{\\text{Decoder}} \\hat{x}$.\n\n\\subsubsection{Convolutional Layers in Decoder}\n% Similar to the Encoder, this component utilizes convolutional layers to increase the spatial dimensions of the quantized representations, effectively reconstructing them into original image dimensions.\n%\n% Input: Quantized representations ($z_q$);\n% Output: Intermediate feature maps for reconstruction ($\\hat{h}$).\n%\n% Workflow: \n% Quantized representation $z_q \\xrightarrow{\\text{Convolutional Layers}} \\hat{h}$.\n\n\\subsubsection{Output Layer}\n% The final step in the Decoder, the Output Layer synthesizes the processed information to generate final reconstructed images, matching original input dimensions and content.\n%\n% Input: Intermediate feature maps ($\\hat{h}$);\n% Output: Final reconstructed images ($\\hat{x}$).\n%\n% Workflow: \n% Feature maps $\\hat{h} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Output Layer}} \\hat{x}$.\n```"
