\subsection{Generative Diffusion Models}

The evolution of generative diffusion models has marked a significant transformation in the landscape of generative modeling, incorporating novel techniques and methodologies that enhance the efficacy and applicability of these models. Central to their innovation is the iterative refinement of samples in a latent space formulation, which promotes high-dimensional data representation (Rombach et al., 2021). A pivotal advancement is the introduction of Classifier-Free Guidance, which has profoundly improved the performance of diffusion models by enhancing image fidelity while concurrently reducing computational costs (Ho et al., 2021). This method effectively optimizes the sampling process, leading to diverse outputs that embody higher quality.

The emergence of Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) epitomizes the integration of diffusion processes within latent spaces, facilitating efficient high-resolution image synthesis (Blattmann et al., 2022). LDMs achieve a nuanced balance between computational speed and output quality, enabling applications that range from artistic image generation to intricate image inpainting tasks. The advanced sampling techniques employed by these models, notably Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM), have bolstered rapid and effective image creation across various domains (Song et al., 2020). 

However, the field is confronted with ongoing challenges, particularly regarding model scalability and minimizing artifacts during the sampling phase. Addressing these limitations is essential to foster broader adoption and utility of generative diffusion models. Future research directions emphasize the need for more sophisticated sampling strategies and the potential integration of retrieval-augmented generation processes. Such advancements aim to bridge the gap between model efficiency and creative task demands.

In this paper, we build upon the foundational advancements within this domain by specifically enhancing multivariate conditional generation through the integration of diffusion models with latent representations. This synthesis not only aspires to elevate the quality of generated outputs but also seeks to contribute novel methodologies that leverage the inherent strengths of existing models while addressing their current limitations.
