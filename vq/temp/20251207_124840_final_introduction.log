\section{Introduction}

Generative models have emerged as a prominent domain in machine learning, particularly in image synthesis, representation learning, and data augmentation. Among these models, Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) have received considerable attention for their ability to effectively integrate the principles of variational inference with discrete representation learning. VQ-VAEs employ a quantization process that maps continuous latent representations to a finite set of discrete vectors, facilitating the capture of complex data distributions \cite{van2017neural}. This methodology not only enhances the generation of high-fidelity outputs but also offers more interpretable latent spaces compared to their continuous counterparts \cite{botta2020gaussian}. However, the incorporation of quantization within the VQ-VAE framework presents challenges related to gradient propagation through non-differentiable layers, often resulting in issues such as codebook collapse and suboptimal usage of latent representations.

Current research efforts in VQ-VAEs predominantly concentrate on improving reconstruction fidelity and the quality of generated samples. Common strategies include employing Gumbel-softmax sampling techniques \cite{jang2016categorical} to smooth the optimization landscape and utilizing various loss functions to stabilize training \cite{tucker2020variational}. Despite these advancements, challenges persist regarding the optimization of gradient flow, particularly in maintaining the structural integrity of learned representations during the quantization process. Notably, existing state-of-the-art approaches fail to adequately address intrinsic issues regarding codebook utilization and the risk of diminishing feature representation diversity. Addressing these persistent challenges is crucial for enhancing generative performance and expanding the applicability of VQ-VAE frameworks.

This research responds to these limitations by proposing an Enhanced VQ-VAE architecture that integrates a Rotation and Rescaling Transformation (RRT) to improve gradient propagation through quantization layers. The incorporation of RRT aims to preserve angular relationships among latent features during backpropagation, thereby enhancing gradient flow and mitigating the risks of codebook collapse. Moreover, the proposed architecture features robust codebook management strategies to encourage diverse embedding usage throughout the training process. This comprehensive approach addresses the challenges associated with effective representation learning while maximizing the advantages of quantization.

The contributions of this research are outlined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduction of a novel RRT mechanism integrated with VQ-VAE to facilitate improved gradient transport across quantization layers.
    \item Development of adaptive codebook management strategies that promote effective utilization of embedding resources.
    \item Empirical validation of the proposed enhancements through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in generative performance metrics.
    \item Insights into the interplay between gradient flow and representation quality, contributing to a deeper understanding of discrete representation learning in generative models.
\end{itemize}
