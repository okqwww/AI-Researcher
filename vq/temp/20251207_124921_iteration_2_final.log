% [Problem Context]
% - Research area and problem statement
% - Current challenges or limitations
Generative models, particularly Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs), are pivotal in fields like image synthesis and data augmentation. Despite their effectiveness, problems like gradient propagation through non-differentiable layers, codebook collapse, and suboptimal embedding utilization hinder their performance.

% [Proposed Solution]
% - Main approach and key innovations
% - Technical highlights
To address these challenges, we propose an Enhanced VQ-VAE architecture that incorporates a Rotation and Rescaling Transformation (RRT) to improve gradient transport across quantization layers. This approach maintains angular relationships among latent features during backpropagation and introduces adaptive codebook management techniques to enhance embedding diversity.

% [Results and Impact]
% - Key experimental findings
% - Practical significance
Through extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset, our enhanced model demonstrates substantial improvements in generative performance metrics. Notably, we observe increased reconstruction quality and more stable training dynamics, underscoring the implications for future applications of VQ-VAE frameworks in practical scenarios.
