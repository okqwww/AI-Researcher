\subsection{Latent Diffusion Models}

Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) mark a pivotal evolution in generative modeling, merging the techniques of variational autoencoders (VAEs) with diffusion processes to enhance sampling efficiency and output quality. The pioneering work by Rombach et al. \cite{rombach2021highresolution} first articulated the framework of LDMs, highlighting their capacity for high-resolution image generation through a latent variable approach. By compressing the high-dimensional image space into a lower-dimensional latent representation, LDMs alleviate the computational burden typically associated with pixel-space diffusion models, enabling faster training and inference.

Subsequent studies have broadened the application and functionality of LDMs. Notably, the incorporation of classifier-free guidance techniques has led to significant improvements in both image fidelity and sampling speed \cite{blatmann2022retrieval}. This advancement illustrates the versatility of LDMs across various tasks, including text-to-image synthesis and inpainting. The adaptability of LDMs provides noteworthy benefits for creative applications, serving as powerful tools for artists and media practitioners \cite{stablediffusion2022}.

Despite the successes of LDMs, challenges remain, particularly in managing the stability of generated outputs and mitigating artifacts during the sampling process \cite{blatmann2022retrieval}. Ongoing research is dedicated to refining architectural elements and enhancing the robustness of sampling methodologies. A deeper inquiry into efficient training paradigms and more sophisticated latent space management strategies is essential as the field matures.

In our proposed work, we aim to build upon the LDM framework, leveraging latent representations to further optimize synthesis quality. By integrating these foundational concepts with advanced generative techniques, our research aspires to push the boundaries of what LDMs can achieve. The evolution and application of LDMs not only underscore their transformative impact on generative modeling but also delineate the future trajectory of high-dimensional image synthesis and related domains.
