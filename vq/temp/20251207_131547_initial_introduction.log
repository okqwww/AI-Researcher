\section{Introduction}

Generative models have become integral to the landscape of machine learning, with numerous applications spanning image generation, text synthesis, and beyond. Among these, Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) have garnered attention due to their ability to model complex data distributions via discrete latent variables. VQ-VAEs operate by encoding continuous data into finite representations, which facilitates efficient storage and retrieval while maintaining robust generative capabilities. The seminal work by van den Oord et al. \cite{vqvae} establishes a strong foundation for this framework, demonstrating effective methods to optimize latent embeddings through a quantization process. This approach is further complemented by advancements in categorical representation learning and variational inference techniques, as outlined by subsequent researchers \cite{botta2020, gumbelsoftmax}.

Despite these advancements, existing VQ-VAE implementations encounter significant challenges, particularly concerning gradient propagation through the non-differentiable quantization layer. The processes involved in quantization can disrupt the flow of gradients necessary for effective learning, leading to issues such as codebook collapse, where many latent codes remain underutilized. This underutilization compromises the model's ability to generate diverse samples, limiting the practical efficacy of VQ-VAEs. Furthermore, the intricate interplay between quantization and gradient descent poses critical challenges that demand innovative solutions. This research addresses these limitations by posing key questions regarding optimal gradient transport and codebook management within the VQ-VAE framework.

In response to these challenges, we propose an Enhanced VQ-VAE architecture that integrates a Rotation and Rescaling Transformation (RRT) to improve gradient transport through the quantization layers. By employing RRT, our approach ensures that angular relationships within the latent space are preserved, thereby optimizing the backpropagation of gradients. Additionally, we introduce robust codebook management strategies to enhance code utilization throughout training. These components work synergistically to maintain effective gradient flow and promote diverse latent representations, ultimately enhancing the generative performance of the model.
