\subsection{Generative Diffusion Models}

Generative diffusion models have garnered significant attention for their ability to synthesize high-quality images and other forms of data. The recent innovations in this domain, especially the integration of text-guided synthesis, have notably enhanced their applications in visual art and content generation. For instance, Classifier-Free Guidance has been a pivotal advancement, optimizing performance while reducing computational overhead \cite{rombach2021highresolution}.

Noteworthy implementations, such as Stable Diffusion \cite{stabilityai2022}, showcase the efficacy of diffusion models in text-to-image generation tasks. Stable Diffusion leverages latent space operations alongside diffusion processes, facilitating high-resolution image generation with a judicious reduction in computational demands. The architecture built upon latent diffusion strategies \cite{rombach2021highresolution} has proven that incorporating text embeddings can lead to a rich variety of images generated from brief textual cues.

Nevertheless, challenges remain. The search for effective sampling techniques that optimize fidelity and speed is still ongoing, with research focused on bolstering the resilience of generative outputs \cite{blattmann2022}. Additionally, the integration of retrieval-augmented generation strategies represents a promising frontier, which could enhance contextual relevance and increase output diversity without compromising quality \cite{rombach2022retrieval}.

Our proposed work aims to build upon these advancements in generative diffusion models by enhancing capabilities for multivariate conditional generation. We intend to employ refined sampling strategies and integrate contemporary architectural innovations to address existing limitations while pushing the creative boundaries within generative models.
