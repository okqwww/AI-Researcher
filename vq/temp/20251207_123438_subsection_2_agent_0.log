\subsection{Decoder}
The Decoder is a crucial element of the proposed architecture, responsible for reconstructing high-fidelity images from the quantized latent representations generated by the Vector Quantizer. By effectively harnessing the rich latent features encoded during the modeling process, the Decoder's primary objective is to ensure that the generated output closely approximates the original input data, thus accommodating the fundamental goals of the generative modeling framework.

\subsubsection{Convolutional Layers in Decoder}
The Decoder is characterized by a series of transposed convolutional layers, which incrementally reconstruct the spatial dimensions of the input data from the quantized representations. These layers progressively upscale and refine the feature maps, thereby facilitating the generation of outputs that are congruent with the original images’ dimensions. Each convolutional layer employs learnable filters that adapt during training, allowing the model to capture essential spatial hierarchies present in the data.

\paragraph{Workflow:}
\begin{align*}
\text{Input:} & \quad \text{Quantized representations } (z_q)\\
\text{Output:} & \quad \text{Intermediate feature maps for reconstruction } (\hat{h})\\
\text{Processing:} & \quad z_q \xrightarrow{\text{Convolutional Layers}} \hat{h}
\end{align*}

The Decoder’s convolutional architecture is designed to amplify the spatial dimensions of the latent representation while meticulously retaining vital visual information. The use of residual connections within these layers enhances gradient flow, thereby improving the reconstruction quality and facilitating the training of deeper networks.

\subsubsection{Output Layer}
The final component of the Decoder is the Output Layer, which synthesizes the processed data from the preceding convolutional layers to yield the final reconstructed images. This layer is critical in ensuring that the output aligns not only with the content of the original images but also adheres to the required pixel dimensions.

\paragraph{Workflow:}
\begin{align*}
\text{Input:} & \quad \text{Intermediate feature maps } (\hat{h})\\
\text{Output:} & \quad \text{Final reconstructed images } (\hat{x})\\
\text{Processing:} & \quad \hat{h} \xrightarrow{\text{Output Layer}} \hat{x}
\end{align*}

The Output Layer applies a sigmoid activation function, effectively constraining pixel values to the range [0, 1]. This normalization process is essential for ensuring that the final output images maintain standard RGB formatting and fidelity. This carefully architected process not only bolsters the accuracy of reconstructions but also enhances the overall stability and performance of the generative model.

By integrating learned quantized representations and employing advanced convolutional techniques, the Decoder adeptly bridges the divide between abstract latent features and comprehensible visual outputs. Moreover, this synergy significantly enriches the modeling capabilities of the VQ-VAE framework as augmented by the Rotation-Rescaling Transform (RRT), promoting superior image generation across various applications.
