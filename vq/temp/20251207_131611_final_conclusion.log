\section{Conclusion}

In this research, we confronted the significant challenges of gradient propagation in Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs), motivated by the need for enhanced image generation fidelity. By proposing an Enhanced VQ-VAE architecture that incorporates a Rotation and Rescaling Transform (RRT), we have introduced a critical innovation aimed at improving gradient flow through quantization layers. Our extensive empirical evaluations revealed marked improvements in reconstruction loss, PSNR, and SSIM metrics, underscoring the effectiveness of these advancements in generative modeling. However, further work is necessary to mitigate codebook utilization issues and reduce FID scores while exploring alternative rotational methods and integrating perceptual loss functions to enhance image quality and representation diversity.
