\subsection{Vector Quantizer}

The Vector Quantizer (VQ) is a fundamental component of our proposed Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) architecture. Its primary function is to discretize continuous latent representations into distinct embeddings. This discretization enables the model to effectively operate with a finite set of embeddings and facilitates the efficient encoding of learned features, thereby enhancing the capacity of the model to capture structured representations essential for high-quality generative modeling.

Central to our implementation is the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) technique for adaptively updating the codebook embeddings. This approach stabilizes the training dynamics and ensures effective backpropagation of gradients, which is particularly crucial in deep neural network architectures. Additionally, we incorporate the Rotation-Rescaling Transform (RRT) to improve gradient transport across the quantization layers, preserving angular relationships during backpropagation.

\subsubsection{Functionality}
During the forward pass, the Vector Quantizer processes the latent representations \( z_e \) generated by the encoder and converts them into quantized outputs \( z_q \). It also computes the quantization loss \( \text{vq\_loss} \), which consists of the commitment loss and codebook loss, and derives various statistics \( \text{stats} \) to provide insights into the training performance. The computational sequence can be mathematically represented as follows:

\begin{equation}
z_e \xrightarrow{\text{Quantizer}} z_q, \quad \text{vq\_loss}, \quad \text{stats}
\end{equation}

Here, \( z_q \) denotes the quantized representation obtained through the VQ mechanism. The term \( \text{vq\_loss} \) is critical for maintaining training stability, ensuring the effective utilization of the model's embeddings. The statistics \( \text{stats} \) encompass valuable metrics, such as perplexity and cluster utilization, which reflect the distribution and the extent of usage of the embeddings within the codebook.

\subsubsection{Embedding Updates}
The quantization process incorporates an adaptive codebook of embeddings, where parameters are updated based on their frequency of use, leveraging EMA techniques. This dynamic mechanism ensures a finely-tuned alignment with the latent space data distribution, enhancing the capture of salient features. The embedding update process can be succinctly described as:

\begin{equation}
\text{Updated Embeddings} \leftarrow \text{EMA}(z_e, \text{encoding indices})
\end{equation}

This method emphasizes the importance of frequently activated embeddings, thereby improving overall model performance while mitigating the influence of infrequently utilized embeddings, fostering a robust representation.

\subsubsection{Gradient Transport via RRT}
To address the challenges presented by the non-differentiability of quantization, we leverage the Rotation-Rescaling Transform (RRT), which plays a pivotal role in our gradient transport strategy. This approach preserves the vector angles during the gradient propagation from quantized representations back to the encoder. Following the quantization, the gradients are transformed according to:

\begin{equation}
z_q \xrightarrow{\text{RRT}} \text{Transformed Gradients}
\end{equation}

The RRT utilizes Householder reflections to maintain the relevance and integrity of the information concerning the corresponding codebook vectors. This preservation ensures effective gradient propagation back to the encoder, thereby significantly enhancing training efficiency and stability.

In conclusion, the Vector Quantizer is a crucial component of our VQ-VAE framework, which enables the discretization of continuous latent representations and optimizes training dynamics through efficient embedding updates and advanced gradient transport methodologies. This integration facilitates accelerated convergence rates and the production of high-quality representations, thus advancing the state-of-the-art in variational inference and generative modeling.
