By proposing an Enhanced VQ-VAE architecture that incorporates a Rotation and Rescaling Transform (RRT), we have introduced a critical innovation aimed at improving gradient flow through quantization layers. Our extensive empirical evaluations revealed marked improvements in reconstruction loss, PSNR, and SSIM metrics, underscoring the effectiveness of these advancements in generative modeling.\n\n% [Future Work]\n% - Potential improvements\n% - New research directions\n% - Open challenges\n\nLooking forward, several opportunities for further exploration are evident. Investigating alternative rotational methods alongside refined codebook utilization strategies could lead to additional enhancements in generative performance. Moreover, integrating perceptual loss functions presents an avenue to improve the perceptual quality of generated images, particularly in relation to achieving lower FID scores. The ongoing exploration into the intricate relationship between gradient flow and representation quality will not only deepen our understanding but also chart new pathways for future research within the domain of generative modeling.\n```"
