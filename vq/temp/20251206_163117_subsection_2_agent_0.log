\subsection{Decoder}

The decoder component of the Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) is pivotal for reconstructing images from the quantized latent representations generated by the vector quantizer. Its architecture effectively mirrors that of the encoder, facilitating the upsampling of lower-dimensional latent features back to the original image dimensions while striving to preserve image fidelity. The design of the decoder integrates transposed convolutions and a residual stack, enhancing the quality and precision of the reconstructed images.

The overall workflow of the decoder can be summarized as follows: it takes the quantized latent representations as input and, through a series of operations involving transposed convolutions and residual blocks, outputs the reconstructed images formatted to match the original dimensions. Mathematically, this process can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{x}_{\text{recon}} = \text{Decoder}(\text{Quantized Representations}),
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{x}_{\text{recon}}$ represents the reconstructed image, highlighting the model's capacity to capture the complexity of image features throughout the decoding process.

\subsubsection{Transposed Convolutions}
Transposed convolutions, commonly referred to as deconvolutions, play a fundamental role in remapping the quantized latent representations to the original image dimensions. This operation is crucial as it allows the decoder to learn spatial features effectively during reconstruction by applying learned filters in an upsampling manner. The decoding process begins with an initial transposed convolution that expands the feature maps, succeeded by another transposed convolution which adjusts the output feature map size to match the original input dimensions.

\textbf{Input:} Quantized latent vectors of size $(D, H', W')$, where $D$ is the dimensionality of the latent representations, and $(H', W')$ are the spatial dimensions. \\
\textbf{Output:} Intermediate feature maps of size $(C, H, W)$ that correspond to the final image dimensions, where $C$ is the number of channels in the output image. \\
\textbf{Workflow:} Quantized Representations $\rightarrow$ Transposed Convolution Operations $\rightarrow$ Upscaled Feature Maps.

\subsubsection{Residual Stack in Decoder}
The decoder employs a residual stack analogous to the encoder, composed of multiple residual blocks that refine the features extracted in the previous stages. This stack enhances the quality of the intermediate feature maps produced by the transposed convolutions, facilitating deeper feature refinement and improving the overall reconstruction process. The inclusion of skip connections within these residual blocks significantly benefits the gradient flow, enabling the decoder to learn more complex, non-linear mappings during the reconstruction process.

\textbf{Input:} Feature maps derived from transposed convolution outputs of size $(C, H, W)$. \\
\textbf{Output:} Final output feature maps of size $(C, H, W)$ that are processed through the residual stack. \\
\textbf{Workflow:} Input Feature Maps $\rightarrow$ Residual Block Transformations $\rightarrow$ Final Output Feature Maps.

The synergy between transposed convolutions and the residual stack equips the VQ-VAE decoder with the capability to efficiently translate the discrete, quantized latent representations into a continuous pixel space. This design not only enables effective reconstruction of high-fidelity images but also enhances the model's ability to capture intricate details and textures, contributing significantly to the overall performance of the VQ-VAE framework.
