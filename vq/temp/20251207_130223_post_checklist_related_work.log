\subsection{Variational Autoencoders and Discrete Representation Learning}
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have significantly influenced discrete representation learning, with key contributions shaping current methodologies. The foundational framework established in "Neural Discrete Representation Learning" presents the Vector Quantized VAE (VQ-VAE) architecture, which facilitates the learning of discrete latent representations \cite{van2017neural}. Subsequently, work by Botta et al. extends this discourse by introducing Gaussian Mixture VAEs, enriching the understanding of categorical latent variables and their application in complex data distributions \cite{botta2021gaussian}. Other notable works, such as those by Gregor et al., emphasize the optimization techniques using KL-divergence and the Gumbel-softmax sampling approach to manage discrete latent variables effectively \cite{gregor2015draw}. Despite these advancements, challenges remain regarding the interpretability of the latent space and optimization strategies, as highlighted by the research of Burgess et al. \cite{burgess2018understanding}. This proposed work aims to leverage insights from VQ-VAEs to enhance representation effectiveness in diffusion models, thereby addressing existing limitations.

\subsection{Latent Diffusion Models}
Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) have emerged as a critical area of research, blending innovative architectures with diffusion processes for image synthesis. In their landmark paper, "High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models," Rombach et al. illustrate how LDMs can synthesize high-resolution images through the manipulation of latent spaces \cite{rombach2021high}. Following this, the work by Dhariwal and Nichol on diffusion models further showcases applications across various creative domains, underscoring their flexibility and broad applicability \cite{dhariwal2021diffusion}. Additionally, studies by Song et al. on generative approaches using diffusion processes point toward nuanced methods for tackling challenges in image generation \cite{song2020score}. Despite these advances, ongoing challenges in scaling LDMs and mitigating artifacts during sampling while preserving diversity in outputs persist, as discussed in recent reviews \cite{ho2020denoising}. The relevance of the proposed work lies in enhancing the synthesis quality by utilizing the latent representations inherent in LDMs, addressing these ongoing challenges.

\subsection{Generative Diffusion Models}
The landscape of generative diffusion models has evolved rapidly, with innovative techniques enhancing their capabilities significantly. Recent advancements include text-guided image generation, a transformative approach exemplified by the work of Saharia et al., which synthesizes visuals directly from textual descriptions \cite{saharia2022palette}. Moreover, the introduction of Classifier-Free Guidance by Ho et al. has markedly improved synthesis performance while concurrently reducing computational demands, establishing a new standard in the field \cite{ho2021classifier}. Emerging trends emphasize the incorporation of retrieval-augmented generation processes, as explored by Zhang et al., to create more contextually rich outputs \cite{zhang2022generative}. However, future directions indicate a need for further refinement in sampling techniques and multi-modal integration for optimized outputs \cite{preechakul2023targeting}. This prospective work seeks to build upon these foundational advancements, specifically aimed at enhancing multivariate conditional generation by integrating strategies from generative diffusion models.
