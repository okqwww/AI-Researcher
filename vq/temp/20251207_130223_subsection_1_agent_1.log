\subsection{Latent Diffusion Models}

Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) mark a significant advancement in the landscape of generative modeling by merging the principles of variational autoencoders with diffusion processes. Pioneering research by Rombach et al. (2021) elucidates a novel architecture that operates in learned latent spaces, thereby facilitating efficient high-resolution image synthesis \cite{rombach2021highresolution}. This innovative approach not only enhances output complexity but also curtails the computational burden by conducting diffusion processes in a latent representation rather than pixel space.

Following the groundwork laid by Rombach et al., subsequent studies have showcased the broad applicability of latent diffusion frameworks across diverse tasks. Notably, the exploration of retrieval-augmented diffusion models facilitates enhanced conditioning through integrated retrieval mechanisms, allowing for more informed generation processes \cite{blattmann2022retrieval}. Furthermore, advancements in sampling techniques, such as the PLMS sampler \cite{blattmann2022plms}, have resulted in enhanced sample quality and significant improvements in sampling speed, highlighting the ongoing technical innovations in this domain.

Despite these achievements, significant challenges persist within the realm of latent diffusion models. One notable issue is the reduction of artifacts during the sampling phase while simultaneously ensuring a diverse range of generated outputs—an area demanding further investigation. While substantial progress has been made regarding image fidelity, a critical balance between generation speed and visual quality remains a substantial hurdle. Furthermore, the complexity involved in conditioning on multi-modal data necessitates deeper exploration, especially regarding the integration of contextual information beyond standard textual prompts and depth cues.

In relation to our proposed work, the employment of latent representations for enhanced synthesis quality aligns closely with methodologies explored in earlier works. By building upon the innovations intrinsic to LDM architectures, we aim to advance generative capabilities while concurrently addressing the enduring challenges related to diversity and artifact management.
