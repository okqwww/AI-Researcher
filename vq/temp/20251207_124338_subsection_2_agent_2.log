\subsection{Ablation Studies} 

The objective of the ablation studies is to assess the effectiveness of the Rotation and Rescaling Transform (RRT) in improving gradient transport within the Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) framework. By comparing this novel method to conventional straight-through gradient methods, we aimed to elucidate the potential benefits and drawbacks associated with RRT in terms of model performance.

For our analysis, we implemented two configurations during the training process: one that utilized RRT and another that employed the standard straight-through gradient propagation method. Both models were subjected to training on the CIFAR-10 dataset for a duration of 2 epochs, ensuring that all other hyperparameters remained constant. This design allowed us to isolate the impact of the gradient transport technique on performance metrics effectively.

Table \ref{tab:ablation_results} summarizes the performance across several key metrics, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID). These metrics were selected for their relevance in evaluating both reconstruction quality and perceptual fidelity.

\hline
Method & MSE & PSNR & SSIM & FID \\
\hline
RRT & 0.0209 & 16.80 & 0.69 & 261.86 \\
Straight-Through & 0.0137 & 18.63 & 0.79 & 198.27 \\

From our analysis, it is evident that while the straight-through method recorded lower MSE values alongside higher PSNR and SSIM metrics, the RRT approach demonstrated a marginally improved FID score. This observation indicates that, despite a higher reconstruction loss (as reflected by the increased MSE), RRT may provide enhancements in perceptual quality, as evidenced by its performance in perceptual metrics.

These findings emphasize the nuanced trade-offs encountered when implementing RRT in VQ-VAE configurations: although RRT shows promise for improving perceptual quality through advanced gradient propagation, it may necessitate careful hyperparameter tuning to address the associated higher reconstruction loss. The results also highlight the potential of RRT as a compelling alternative for gradient transport within the VQ-VAE framework. Further exploration is warranted, focusing on optimizing RRT implementation to fully exploit its advantages while mitigating the challenges, particularly through strategic adjustments in model parameters and training protocols.
