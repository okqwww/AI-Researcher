Use the selected code vector for reconstruction.\n   - **Step 4**: Reparameterize the selected code vector using the performed linear transformation (C * W), effectively treating both C and W in the optimization process.\n   - **Step 5**: Calculate the loss, which combines reconstruction loss (MSE between original and decoded output) and commitment loss to ensure effective use of the codebook.\n   - **Step 6**: Update only the linear layer (W) through gradient backpropagation, keeping C static throughout this phase to facilitate the joint training procedure.\n\n6. **Critical Implementation Details**:\n   - To prevent representation collapse, it is crucial to carefully set the learning rate so that the transformation matrix W can adapt without compromising the usefulness of the latent space.\n   - Keeping the codebook static during the initial phase speeds up the convergence while ensuring that the linear transformation can stretch and rotate the latent space effectively.\n   - Regularly evaluate the utilization percentage of the codebook during training iterations, aiming for near-complete usage (ideally 100%) to combat representation collapse actively.",
