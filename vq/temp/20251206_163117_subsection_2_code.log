\subsection{Decoder}

The decoder component of the Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) reconstructs images from the quantized latent representations produced by the vector quantizer. Its architecture mirrors that of the encoder to effectively upsample lower-dimensional latent features back to the original image dimensions while preserving image fidelity. The decoder's design incorporates transposed convolutions and a residual stack to enhance the quality of the reconstructed images.

\subsubsection{Transposed Convolutions}
Transposed convolutions, also known as deconvolutions, are utilized to remap the quantized latent representations to the original image dimensions. This operation facilitates the learning of spatial features during the reconstruction process by applying learned filters in an upsampling manner. The sequence includes an initial transposed convolution to expand the feature maps followed by another transposed convolution to yield the final output size matching the original image dimensions.

\textbf{Input:} Quantized latent vectors of size $(C, H', W')$. \\
\textbf{Output:} Intermediate feature maps of size $(C, H, W)$ that match the original image dimensions. \\
\textbf{Workflow:} Quantized Representations $\rightarrow$ Transposed Convolution Operations $\rightarrow$ Intermediate Feature Maps.

\subsubsection{Residual Stack in Decoder}
Analogous to the encoder, the decoder employs a residual stack composed of multiple residual blocks. This stack processes the intermediate feature maps produced by the transposed convolutions, enabling more profound feature refinement. The inclusion of skip connections within the residual blocks helps maintain gradient flow, allowing the decoder to learn more complex mappings during the reconstruction process.

\textbf{Input:} Feature maps derived from transposed convolution outputs. \\
\textbf{Output:} Final output feature maps ready for image representation. \\
\textbf{Workflow:} Input Feature Maps $\rightarrow$ Residual Block Transformations $\rightarrow$ Final Output Feature Maps.

The decoding process can be mathematically represented as:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{x}_{\text{recon}} = \text{Decoder}(\text{Quantized Representations}),
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{x}_{\text{recon}}$ denotes the reconstructed image and captures the complexity of image features through the combination of transposed convolutions and residual learning.

Overall, the decoder is integral in translating the discrete, quantized latent space back into a continuous pixel space, thereby enabling effective reconstruction of high-fidelity images that mirror the original inputs. The residual learning strategy enhances the model's ability to capture intricate details, contributing significantly to the overall performance of the VQ-VAE framework.
