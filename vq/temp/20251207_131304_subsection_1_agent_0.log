\subsection{Latent Diffusion Models}
Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) represent a significant advancement in the generative modeling space, particularly noted for their efficiency and quality of image synthesis. One of the standout contributions is described in the seminal work "High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models" by Rombach et al. (2021), which outlines an innovative architecture that leverages latent spaces within the context of diffusion processes \cite{rombach2021highresolution}. By operating in a reduced latent representation rather than pixel space, these models significantly lower the computational burden while preserving the high fidelity of generated images.

Following this foundational work, the introduction of various applications for LDMs has further demonstrated their versatility, such as the integration with several retrieval-augmented diffusion techniques that enhance creative tasks through data conditioning. These models have proven effective in generating images conditioned by text prompts, showcasing their capabilities in text-to-image synthesis, as exemplified in the latest updates from Stability AI's "Stable Diffusion" models which utilize LDM frameworks to produce diverse and high-quality outputs \cite{stabilityai2023}.

Despite these advancements, there remain several challenges in the deployment of LDMs, particularly concerning the optimization during the sampling process. Issues with scaling and the mitigation of artifacts without sacrificing generative diversity continue to pose significant hurdles. Recent improvements, such as classifier-free guidance, have sought to address some of these limitations by allowing for more robust samples while minimizing the computational overhead \cite{blatmann2022}. 

Overall, the connection to our proposed work lies in leveraging the strengths of LDMs, particularly their latent representations, to enhance synthesis quality and address some of the ongoing challenges in generative frameworks.
