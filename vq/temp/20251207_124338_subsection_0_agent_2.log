\subsection{Experimental Settings}

In this study, we conducted a comprehensive series of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed enhancements to Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs), specifically focusing on the Rotation and Rescaling Transform (RRT) using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The experimental settings are elaborated below.

\subsubsection{Datasets and Preprocessing}
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of a total of 60,000 color images of size 32x32 pixels, categorized into 10 distinct classes, each containing 6,000 images. For our experiments, the dataset was split into a training set comprising 50,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images. The CIFAR-10 dataset can be accessed via the following path: \texttt{/workplace/dataset_candidate/cifar-10-python.tar.gz}.

To optimize model performance, we implemented several preprocessing steps. Each image was normalized to a pixel value range of [0, 1]. Additionally, during training, standard data augmentation techniques such as random cropping and horizontal flipping were deployed to enhance the model's generalization capability and robustness. 

\subsubsection{Evaluation Metrics}
We employed a suite of metrics to rigorously evaluate the performance of our model. The primary evaluation metrics included:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Frechet Inception Distance (FID)}: This metric quantifies the distance between the distributions of generated images and real images, with lower values indicating higher quality.
    \item \textbf{Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)}: It measures the quality of the reconstructed images, with higher values indicative of better image fidelity.
    \item \textbf{Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)}: This statistic evaluates the level of similarity between the original and generated images, where values closer to 1 signify better correspondence.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Baselines}
To benchmark the performance of the enhanced VQ-VAE model, we compared it against several baseline models:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Standard Variational Autoencoders (VAE)}: This baseline utilizes a conventional VAE architecture for comparative analysis.
    \item \textbf{Standard Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)}: A prominent generative model providing a reference point for image generation performance.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Implementation Details}
The implementation was built upon the VQ-VAE architecture, augmented with the Rotation and Rescaling Transform (RRT) to improve gradient propagation. The principal configuration details for our experiments are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:implementation_details}.

The Adam optimizer was utilized for training, facilitating efficient adjustments of model parameters. Training was conducted using a state-of-the-art GPU, which significantly accelerated the process.

Overall, this comprehensive experimental setup was designed to systematically assess the efficacy of the proposed enhancements and their potential impact on the performance of VQ-VAE models in the image generation tasks.
