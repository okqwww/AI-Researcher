\subsection{Decoder}

The decoder of the Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) is integral to the process of reconstructing images from the quantized latent representations generated by the vector quantizer. Designed as a mirror image of the encoder architecture, the decoder’s primary function is to express lower-dimensional latent features in the original image space while maintaining high image quality and fidelity. This is achieved through the use of transposed convolutions combined with a series of residual blocks, which together refine and enhance the precision of the reconstructed images.

The decoding process can be encapsulated in the following workflow: the decoder receives quantized latent representations as input, processes them through a succession of transposed convolutional layers that increase the spatial dimensions, and applies residual blocks for further feature refinement. This culminates in the generation of reconstructed images that are consistent with the original input dimensions. The decoding operation can be mathematically articulated as:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{x}_{\text{recon}} = \text{Decoder}(\text{Quantized Representations}),
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{x}_{\text{recon}}$ represents the reconstructed image, highlighting the decoder's capability to capture complex image features during the reconstruction phase.

\subsubsection{Transposed Convolutions}
Transposed convolutions play a pivotal role in remapping quantized latent representations back to their original dimensions. This operation is crucial, as it allows the decoder to learn spatial features essential for effective reconstruction by applying learned filters in an upsampling manner. The decoding process initiates with a transposed convolution that expands the latent feature maps, followed by subsequent transposed convolutions that progressively refine the output to correspond with the desired image dimensions.

\textbf{Input:} Quantized latent vectors of size $(D, H', W')$, where $D$ signifies the dimensionality of the latent representations, and $(H', W')$ denote the spatial dimensions. \\
\textbf{Output:} Intermediate feature maps of size $(C, H, W)$ that align with the final image dimensions, where $C$ represents the number of output channels. \\
\textbf{Workflow:} Quantized Representations $\rightarrow$ Transposed Convolution Operations $\rightarrow$ Upscaled Feature Maps.

\subsubsection{Residual Stack in Decoder}
Similar to the encoder, the decoder employs a residual stack comprising multiple residual blocks designed to enhance the intermediate feature representations obtained during the transposed convolution phase. This architecture not only enriches the feature depiction but also addresses potential degradation that may occur in deeper networks, ensuring the final output closely resembles the original input images. The use of skip connections within the residual blocks significantly bolsters gradient flow, allowing the model to learn intricate, non-linear mappings during reconstruction.

\textbf{Input:} Feature maps emerging from the transposed convolutions, sized $(C, H, W)$. \\
\textbf{Output:} Processed output feature maps, retaining size $(C, H, W)$, ready for image formation. \\
\textbf{Workflow:} Input Feature Maps $\rightarrow$ Residual Block Transformations $\rightarrow$ Final Output Feature Maps.

The collaborative mechanism of transposed convolutions and the residual stack endows the VQ-VAE decoder with an enhanced capacity to efficiently convert discrete, quantized latent representations back into a continuous pixel space. This design not only facilitates the reconstruction of high-fidelity images but also ensures that subtle details and textures are faithfully preserved, significantly elevating the overall performance of the VQ-VAE framework.
