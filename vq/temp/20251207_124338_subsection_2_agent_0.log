\subsection{Ablation Studies} % Exploring the effects of different components

The purpose of these ablation studies is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Rotation and Rescaling Transform (RRT) in enhancing gradient transport compared to standard straight-through gradient methods. To achieve this, we conducted experiments with two configurations: one utilizing the RRT and the other employing conventional straight-through gradients.

For this investigation, models were trained for 2 epochs under both configurations, with all other hyperparameters held constant. The experimental results, encapsulated in the table below, present a comparative analysis of various performance metrics, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Method & MSE & PSNR & SSIM & FID \\
\hline
RRT & 0.0209 & 16.80 & 0.69 & 261.86 \\
Straight-Through & 0.0137 & 18.63 & 0.79 & 198.27 \\

\end{tabular}
\caption{Ablation study results comparing RRT to standard straight-through gradient methods.}
\end{table}

Analysis of the results indicates that while the straight-through method yielded lower MSE and higher PSNR and SSIM values, the RRT method produced a slightly improved FID score, evidencing potential benefits in perceptual quality despite its higher reconstruction loss. The increased MSE associated with the RRT suggests that greater attention may be needed in tuning hyperparameters when employing this gradient propagation method.

These findings support the viability of RRT as a competitive alternative for gradient transport in VQ-VAEs. Furthermore, the results underscore a critical trade-off: while RRT may enhance perceptual metrics, it could also lead to challenges in reconstruction quality, as evidenced by the higher MSE. Future work will explore mechanisms to fully leverage the strengths of RRT while mitigating its drawbacks, particularly through careful adjustment of model parameters.
