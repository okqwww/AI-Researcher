\subsection{Generative Diffusion Models}
Generative diffusion models have garnered significant attention due to their effective capability in generating high-quality images from noise. An essential advancement in this field is the emergence of text-guided synthesis, which integrates natural language prompts into the diffusion process, enhancing the controllability of the generated outputs. The landmark work, "High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models" \cite{Rombach2021}, introduced a novel architecture that amalgamates diffusion processes with latent variable modeling, achieving state-of-the-art results in image synthesis. This framework allows the model to operate in a lower-dimensional latent space, significantly improving computational efficiency while maintaining generation quality.

A remarkable technique that has proven beneficial in generative diffusion models is Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which allows for more flexible image generation by leveraging classifier outputs without the need for an additional model, thus reducing computational costs and simplifying the training process \cite{classifier_free_guidance}. Future directions in this area propose exploring advanced sampling techniques that could further refine image quality and diversity, particularly in the context of multivariate conditional generation tasks.

The integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) processes represents another promising avenue for enhancing diffusion models. By incorporating retrieval mechanisms, future generative models could leverage external datasets to inform and enrich the generation process, leading to more contextually relevant and high-fidelity outputs \cite{retrieval_augmented_diffusion}.

While significant advancements have been achieved, challenges remain. High complexity and demand for computational resources continue to present barriers to more widespread application of these models. Additionally, preserving diversity in generated samples while minimizing artifacts during the sampling process remains an active area of research. The proposed work aims to build upon the advancements in generative diffusion models by enhancing multivariate conditional generation, addressing these challenges, and leveraging the innovations discussed to push the boundaries of generative model performance.
