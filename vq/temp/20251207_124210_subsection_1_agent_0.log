\subsection{Latent Diffusion Models}

Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) represent a significant advancement in generative modeling by combining the strengths of variational autoencoders (VAEs) with diffusion processes. The seminal work by Rombach et al. \cite{rombach2021highresolution} introduced the concept of LDMs, demonstrating their efficacy in high-resolution image synthesis. This innovative architecture leverages latent space representations to facilitate the training of diffusion models, allowing for the generation of high-fidelity images while maintaining computational efficiency.

Subsequent developments have focused on refining the efficiency and versatility of LDMs. For instance, the integration of classifier-free guidance techniques has markedly improved sampling speed and image quality \cite{blatmann2022retrieval}, showcasing the models' utility in a broad range of creative tasks, including text-to-image synthesis and inpainting. This highlights the adaptability of LDMs to various forms of conditional generation, making them an attractive choice for applications in visual arts and media \cite{stablediffusion2022}.

Despite these advances, several challenges persist, particularly concerning the stability of the generated samples and the occurrence of artifacts during sampling \cite{blatmann2022retrieval}. Researchers are actively working to address these issues by optimizing the architecture further and enhancing the robustness of the sampling mechanisms. As the field evolves, exploration into more efficient training strategies and improved latent space management continues to gain traction.

The proposed work aims to utilize latent representations within diffusion frameworks inspired by these advancements. By building upon the foundational principles established by LDMs, this research seeks to enhance the synthesis quality through innovative coupling of latent variables with advanced generative techniques. Overall, the development and application of LDMs demonstrate a profound shift in the capabilities of generative models, bridging the gap between complex latent structures and high-dimensional image generation.
