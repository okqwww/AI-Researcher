\subsection{Variational Autoencoders and Discrete Representation Learning}
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have become a foundational technique in the realm of representation learning, particularly for discrete representations. Kingma and Welling's seminal work on VAEs \cite{kingma2013auto} introduced a new paradigm for generative modeling by combining stochastic variational inference with neural networks. Building on this, the concept of Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) was articulated in \cite{van2017neural}, demonstrating how codebook-based representations could enhance learning efficiency and output quality. Furthermore, Botta’s research on Gaussian Mixture VAEs \cite{botta2020Gaussian} extends these ideas by exploring categorical latent variables, offering insights into adaptive representation mechanisms. Additional technical frameworks, such as the Gumbel-softmax technique \cite{jang2016categorical}, have also played a significant role in managing discrete latent variables more effectively. Despite these advancements, challenges persist regarding the interpretability and optimization of the latent space, which can hinder practical deployment \cite{gulrajani2017improved}. Our work aims to leverage the foundational techniques of VQ-VAEs to improve representation within diffusion models, thus addressing some of these limitations.

\subsection{Latent Diffusion Models}
Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) represent a significant evolution in generative modeling architectures. The innovative approach outlined by Rombach et al. in \( \cite{rombach2021high} \) showcases how combining latent representation with diffusion processes can yield high-resolution image synthesis. Further contributions from CompVis \cite{compvis2021} have expanded the application of LDMs across various creative tasks, demonstrating their versatility in generating diverse outputs while retaining high quality. Other foundational studies have highlighted the scalability issues and the challenge of minimizing artifacts in generated images without sacrificing originality \cite{ho2020denoising}. In conjunction with these challenges, our proposed work aims to utilize the established latent representations in LDMs to enhance generation quality, addressing existing limitations in the synthesis process.

\subsection{Generative Diffusion Models}
Recent advancements in generative diffusion models have introduced innovative methodologies that push the boundaries of generative tasks. Research has highlighted the efficacy of Classifier-Free Guidance in enhancing the performance of these models while simultaneously lowering computational demands \cite{ dhariwal2021diffusion}. Other studies have explored text-guided synthesis \cite{chen2021generative} and the integration of neural networks with diffusion processes to improve contextual generation abilities. Additionally, emerging trends in retrieval-augmented generation processes indicate a promising direction for future research \cite{lewis2020retrieval}. By exploring advanced sampling techniques, our work seeks to build upon these methodologies to further augment multivariate conditional generation, thereby expanding the capabilities of generative diffusion frameworks.
