\subsection{Decoder}

The decoder in the Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) plays a pivotal role in reconstructing images from the quantized latent representations generated by the vector quantizer. It is architecturally symmetrical to the encoder, designed specifically to transform the lower-dimensional latent features back into the original image dimensions. This reconstruction process is paramount for preserving the quality and fidelity of the output images. The decoder employs a structured sequence of transposed convolutional layers, supported by residual blocks, to enhance feature representation, ensuring that the intricate details and structural complexities of the input images are faithfully retrieved.

The decoding process can be articulated through several key steps: it starts with the input of quantized latent representations, which are processed iteratively through a series of transposed convolutional layers that increase the spatial dimensions. Subsequently, residual blocks are applied to refine these outputs further, ultimately leading to the generation of reconstructed images that match the dimensions of the original inputs. Mathematically, this operation is expressed as follows:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{x}_{\text{recon}} = \text{Decoder}(\mathbf{z}_{\text{quant}}),
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{x}_{\text{recon}}$ denotes the reconstructed output image. This formulation highlights the decoder's capability to recover essential details and complex structures required for high-quality image reconstruction.

\subsubsection{Transposed Convolutions}
Transposed convolutions are integral to the decoder, facilitating the transformation of quantized latent representations back to their original spatial dimensions. This operation is crucial for enabling the model to learn essential spatial features that are vital for effective image reconstruction. The decoding process begins with an initial transposed convolution, which expands the dimensions of the latent feature maps. The following layers of transposed convolutions then fine-tune these outputs ensuring they are properly aligned with the target image dimensions.

\textbf{Input:} Quantized latent vectors of size $(D, H', W')$, where $D$ represents the dimensionality of the latent representations, and $(H', W')$ denote the spatial dimensions of the feature maps. \\
\textbf{Output:} Intermediate feature maps of size $(C, H, W)$, where $C$ signifies the number of output channels dedicated to reconstructing the final image. \\
\textbf{Workflow:} Quantized Representations $\rightarrow$ Transposed Convolution Operations $\rightarrow$ Upscaled Feature Maps.

\subsubsection{Residual Stack in Decoder}
In alignment with the encoder, the decoder incorporates a residual stack consisting of multiple residual blocks aimed at enhancing the quality of the feature representations derived during the transposed convolution phase. This architectural strategy effectively mitigates the degradation challenges typically associated with deeper networks. The integration of skip connections within the residual blocks significantly improves gradient flow, thereby augmenting the model's ability to capture complex and non-linear relationships during the reconstruction process.

\textbf{Input:} Feature maps that result from the transposed convolution operations, sized $(C, H, W)$. \\
\textbf{Output:} Refined feature maps of the same size $(C, H, W)$, which are culminated for image representation. \\
\textbf{Workflow:} Input Feature Maps $\rightarrow$ Residual Block Transformations $\rightarrow$ Final Output Feature Maps.

The combined functionality of transposed convolutions and the residual stack equips the VQ-VAE decoder with a robust mechanism to convert discrete, quantized latent representations back into a continuous pixel space. This architecture not only enables high-fidelity reconstructions but also ensures meticulous preservation of subtle details and textures essential for enhancing the overall efficacy of the VQ-VAE framework. Furthermore, significant attention to crucial training parameters—including the codebook size, commitment loss, and advanced techniques such as Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) for codebook updates—contributes collectively to stabilizing the learning process and averting codebook collapse over iterations. This comprehensive approach bolsters both the fidelity and robustness of the outputs generated by the VQ-VAE model.
