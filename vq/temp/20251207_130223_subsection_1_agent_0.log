\subsection{Latent Diffusion Models}

Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) represent a substantial advancement in generative modeling, primarily through the integration of variational autoencoders with diffusion processes. The foundational work, "High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models" by Rombach et al. (2021), introduces a novel architecture that leverages latent spaces for efficient high-resolution image synthesis \cite{rombach2021highresolution}. This approach allows for the generation of complex images while maintaining a manageable computational footprint by performing diffusion in a learned latent space rather than pixel space.

Subsequent research has demonstrated the versatility of latent diffusion frameworks across various applications. Notably, the integration of retrieval mechanisms has been explored in retrieval-augmented diffusion models, providing enhanced conditioning information to better guide the generation process \cite{blattmann2022retrieval}. The coupling of LDMs with advanced sampling techniques, such as the PLMS sampler \cite{blattmann2022plms}, has shown improvements in both sample quality and sampling speed. 

Despite these advancements, several challenges remain. For instance, artifact reduction during sampling while ensuring diversity in generated images is an ongoing area of research. While LDMs have made strides in image fidelity, optimizing the balance between speed and visual quality remains a significant technical hurdle. Moreover, the complexity of conditioning on multi-modal data requires further exploration, particularly regarding the integration of additional context beyond textual prompts or depths.

In relation to the proposed work, the utilization of latent representations for enhancing synthesis quality particularly resonates with the methodologies proposed in prior works. By building on the innovations in LDM architectures, we seek to further improve generative capabilities while addressing the remaining challenges in diversity and artifact control.
