\subsection{Generative Diffusion Models}

Recent developments in generative diffusion models have been pivotal in advancing the field of generative modeling, showcasing significant innovations such as text-guided synthesis and neural network integration. This approach leverages the concept of iteratively refining samples in a latent space, allowing for high-dimensional data representation (Rombach et al., 2021). The introduction of Classifier-Free Guidance has notably enhanced diffusion model performance by improving image quality while reducing computational overhead (Ho et al., 2021). This technique optimizes the sampling process, allowing models to generate diverse outputs with higher fidelity.

Moreover, methodologies such as Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) have emerged, integrating diffusion processes within latent spaces, thus enabling efficient generation of high-resolution images (Blattmann et al., 2022). These models maintain a balance between speed and quality, making them suitable for a variety of applications, from artistic image generation to complex image inpainting tasks. LDMs utilize advanced sampling techniques, such as DDIM (Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models), which facilitate rapid and effective image synthesis across multiple domains (Song et al., 2020).

Nonetheless, the field faces challenges, particularly in terms of scaling models while minimizing artifacts during the sampling phase. Addressing these challenges remains critical for the widespread adoption and application of generative diffusion models. Future research directions suggest exploring more sophisticated sampling strategies and integrating retrieval-augmented generation processes to further bridge the gap between creative tasks and model efficiency.

The prospective work presented in this paper aims to build on these advancements, specifically enhancing multivariate conditional generation through the integration of diffusion models with latent representations. This synthesis not only seeks to improve the quality of generated outputs but also endeavors to offer new methodologies that leverage the strengths of existing models while mitigating their limitations.
