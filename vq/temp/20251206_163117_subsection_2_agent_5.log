\subsection{Decoder}

The decoder in the Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) plays a crucial role in reconstructing images from the quantized latent representations generated by the vector quantizer. Designed symmetrically to the encoder, the decoder's architecture is tailored to convert lower-dimensional latent features back into the original image dimensions seamlessly. This reconstruction is vital for preserving the quality and fidelity of the output images, which is accomplished through a series of transposed convolutional layers and enhanced by residual blocks to improve feature representation.

The decoding process unfolds through several key steps: the decoder receives the quantized latent representations as its input, processes them through a cascade of transposed convolutional layers, and leverages residual blocks to refine the extracted features. The output of this decoding workflow is the reconstructed images that correspond to the original input dimensions. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{x}_{\text{recon}} = \text{Decoder}(\text{Quantized Representations}),
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{x}_{\text{recon}}$ denotes the reconstructed image, underscoring the decoder's capability to recover intricate details and structures necessary for high-quality image reconstruction.

\subsubsection{Transposed Convolutions}
Transposed convolutions are integral to progressively mapping quantized latent representations back to their original spatial dimensions. This operation enables the learning of essential spatial features necessary for effective image reconstruction. The decoding process begins with an initial transposed convolution that expands the dimensions of the latent feature maps. Subsequent transposed convolutions serve to fine-tune these outputs, ensuring they align properly with the target image dimensions.

\textbf{Input:} Quantized latent vectors with dimensions $(D, H', W')$, where $D$ represents the dimensionality of the latent representations, while $(H', W')$ denote the spatial dimensions of the feature maps. \\
\textbf{Output:} Intermediate feature maps with dimensions $(C, H, W)$, where $C$ corresponds to the number of output channels aimed at reconstructing the final image. \\
\textbf{Workflow:} Quantized Representations $\rightarrow$ Transposed Convolution Operations $\rightarrow$ Upscaled Feature Maps.

\subsubsection{Residual Stack in Decoder}
Reflecting the design of the encoder, the decoder incorporates a residual stack consisting of multiple residual blocks that are intended to enhance and refine the feature representations accrued during the transposed convolution phase. This architectural strategy not only enriches the feature extraction process but also alleviates the degradation issues typically observed in deeper neural networks. Consequently, this ensures that the final output closely resembles the original input images. The architecture employs skip connections within the residual blocks, which significantly enhances gradient flow, thus facilitating the model's capability to effectively capture complex and non-linear relationships during the reconstruction process.

\textbf{Input:} Feature maps resulting from the transposed convolution operations, of size $(C, H, W)$. \\
\textbf{Output:} Processed output feature maps that retain the size $(C, H, W)$, ready for reconstruction into the final image format. \\
\textbf{Workflow:} Input Feature Maps $\rightarrow$ Residual Block Transformations $\rightarrow$ Final Output Feature Maps.

The synergy between transposed convolutions and the residual stack equips the VQ-VAE decoder with a robust capability to translate discrete, quantized latent representations back into a continuous pixel space. This architecture not only supports high-fidelity reconstructions but also ensures meticulous preservation of subtle details and textures, thereby significantly enhancing the overall effectiveness of the VQ-VAE framework. Furthermore, careful consideration of critical parameters such as the codebook size, commitment loss, and training configurations—including the implementation of an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for codebook updates—collectively contribute to stabilizing the learning process and prevent codebook collapse over time. This holistic approach increases both the fidelity and robustness of the output generated by the VQ-VAE model.
