\subsection{Decoder}
The Decoder is a pivotal component of the proposed architecture, tasked with reconstructing high-fidelity images from the quantized latent representations produced by the Vector Quantizer. By leveraging the rich latent features encoded during the modeling phase, the Decoder's primary objective is to ensure that the generated output closely resembles the original input data, thereby fulfilling the core objectives of the generative modeling framework.

\subsubsection{Convolutional Layers in Decoder}
The Decoder consists of a sequence of transposed convolutional layers, which progressively restore the spatial dimensions of the input data from the quantized representations. These layers systematically upscale and refine feature maps, thereby facilitating the generation of outputs that align with the dimensions of the original images. Each convolutional layer utilizes learnable filters that adapt throughout the training process, enabling the model to effectively capture essential spatial hierarchies inherent in the data.

\paragraph{Workflow:}
\begin{align*}
\text{Input:} & \quad \text{Quantized representations } (z_q)\\
\text{Output:} & \quad \text{Intermediate feature maps for reconstruction } (\hat{h})\\
\text{Processing:} & \quad z_q \xrightarrow{\text{Convolutional Layers}} \hat{h}
\end{align*}

The architecture of the Decoder is designed to amplify the spatial dimensions of the latent representation while meticulously preserving crucial visual information. The integration of residual connections within these layers enhances gradient flow, significantly improving reconstruction quality and facilitating the training process of deeper networks.

\subsubsection{Output Layer}
The final element of the Decoder is the Output Layer, which synthesizes the processed data from the preceding convolutional layers into the final reconstructed images. This layer is critical in ensuring that the output not only matches the content of the original images but also complies with the requisite pixel dimensions.

\paragraph{Workflow:}
\begin{align*}
\text{Input:} & \quad \text{Intermediate feature maps } (\hat{h})\\
\text{Output:} & \quad \text{Final reconstructed images } (\hat{x})\\
\text{Processing:} & \quad \hat{h} \xrightarrow{\text{Output Layer}} \hat{x}
\end{align*}

The Output Layer applies a sigmoid activation function, which effectively constrains the pixel values to the range [0, 1]. This normalization process is crucial for ensuring that the final output images maintain standard RGB formatting and exhibit high fidelity. This carefully architected sequence not only enhances the reconstruction accuracy but also bolsters the overall robustness and performance of the generative model.

By integrating learned quantized representations and employing sophisticated convolutional techniques, the Decoder adeptly bridges the gap between abstract latent features and comprehensible visual outputs. Moreover, this synergy greatly amplifies the modeling capabilities of the Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) framework, especially when augmented by methods such as the Rotation-Rescaling Transformation (RRT).

The RRT enhances gradient flow throughout the quantization process by implementing transformations that maintain angular relations, enabling effective backpropagation in otherwise non-differentiable settings. This significant innovation ensures more effective learning within the quantization layers, leading to improved overall performance of the model.
