\subsection{Variational Autoencoders and Discrete Representation Learning}
Variational autoencoders (VAEs) have gained significant attention in the realm of generative models, forming a basis for discrete representation learning. The work by van den Oord et al. introduces the Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), which lays foundational concepts for capturing discrete representations \cite{van2017neural}. Subsequent developments, such as those by Botta et al., explore Gaussian Mixture VAEs, which expand on the notion of categorical latent variables, providing a richer framework for modeling data distributions \cite{botta2020gaussian}. Key methodologies employed in these frameworks include the use of KL-divergence for optimization and the Gumbel-softmax technique to effectively manage discrete latent variables \cite{jang2016categorical}.

Despite these contributions, several challenges remain, particularly concerning optimization strategies and the interpretability of latent spaces. Recent studies have sought to address these barriers, focusing on enhancing the structure of latent representations to improve performance \cite{tucker2020variational}. Our work is closely aligned with this trajectory, as we leverage VQ-VAEs to facilitate effective representation in diffusion models, aiming to bridge the gap between discrete learning and advanced generative processes.

\subsection{Latent Diffusion Models}
Latent diffusion models (LDMs) represent a burgeoning area of research, integrating latent variable modeling with diffusion processes to synthesize high-resolution images. The seminal paper by Rombach et al. highlights novel architectures that utilize latent spaces effectively within these generative paradigms \cite{rombach2021high}. CompVis has also made significant strides in applying LDMs to various creative tasks, illustrating the versatility and performance of these methodologies across different domains, including text and image synthesis \cite{compvis2021latent}. Furthermore, innovative techniques have been developed to improve sampling processes and reduce artifacts, thus enhancing diversity in generated outputs \cite{dhariwal2021diffusion}.

Despite these advancements, challenges persist, particularly in scaling LDMs and ensuring the fidelity of outputs. Our proposed work seeks to address these issues by utilizing latent representations to improve synthesis quality, thereby contributing to the ongoing evolution of latent diffusion methodologies and their applications.

\subsection{Generative Diffusion Models}
Generative diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool for data synthesis, showcasing a variety of innovative applications and techniques. Recent literature illustrates a trend toward enhancing these models through text-guided synthesis and advanced neural integration \cite{ho2020denoising}. Classifier-Free Guidance has been particularly influential, demonstrating improvements in performance while simultaneously reducing computational overhead \cite{sohl2019deep}. Additionally, the exploration of retrieval-augmented generation processes represents a promising future direction in this field, pushing the boundaries of conditional generative capabilities \cite{cao2021using}.

Despite the progress made, there remains considerable potential for further innovation in sampling techniques and model optimization. Our work seeks to contribute to this evolving landscape by leveraging the advancements in generative diffusion models to enhance multivariate conditional generation. We aim to explore new methodologies that integrate these concepts, which can lead to improved results in practical applications.
