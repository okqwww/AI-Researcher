\subsection{Variational Autoencoders and Discrete Representation Learning}

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have emerged as a fundamental framework for learning latent representations from complex datasets, particularly in high-dimensional spaces. A seminal contribution to this area is the Vector Quantised Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), introduced by van den Oord et al. in their pivotal work, "Neural Discrete Representation Learning" \cite{p1}. The VQ-VAE architecture transitions from continuous to discrete representations by employing vector quantization, which allows for efficient modeling of data distributions while enhancing the fidelity of reconstructions. This approach effectively addresses the challenges associated with posterior collapse, a common issue encountered in traditional VAEs.

Building on these foundational ideas, Edoardo Botta's research further extends the VAE framework by integrating Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and focusing on the efficacious incorporation of categorical latent variables \cite{p2}. This enhancement permits a more sophisticated structure within the latent space, thereby facilitating the capture of complex patterns that are prevalent in multi-modal datasets. The methodologies employed in these works primarily revolve around maximizing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) through variational inference, optimizing a balance between reconstruction fidelity and latent space regularization.

A critical innovation in this domain is the Gumbel-Softmax technique, which enables the differentiable sampling of categorical variables \cite{p3}. This method addresses the inherent non-differentiability challenge when training VAEs with discrete latent variables, allowing for more effective optimization via gradient descent. The Gumbel-Softmax distribution provides a smooth approximation to categorical sampling, which is significant for tasks requiring discrete representations.

Despite these advancements, challenges remain regarding the interpretability and optimization of latent spaces within discrete representation learning. Recent studies have noted that the optimization landscape can be intricate, necessitating careful tuning of hyperparameters and sophisticated training strategies to mitigate the risk of falling into local minima \cite{p4}. Furthermore, while the innovations in discrete representation learning provide robust models, understanding the implications of the latent structures on downstream tasks is an area ripe for exploration.

In alignment with our proposed work, leveraging the capabilities of VQ-VAEs introduces a promising pathway for effective representation learning within diffusion models. By utilizing the discrete latent representations acquired through VQ-VAEs, we aim to improve both the quality and diversity of outputs generated by our models, addressing the limitations faced by previous generative frameworks.
