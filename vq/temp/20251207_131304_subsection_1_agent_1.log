\subsection{Latent Diffusion Models}
Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) have emerged as a pivotal advancement in generative modeling, particularly recognized for their capability to synthesize high-resolution images with both efficiency and quality. The foundational work by Rombach et al. (2021) titled "High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models" provides a detailed exploration of a novel architecture that integrates latent spaces within diffusion processes, allowing models to operate on compressed representations rather than on pixel space \cite{rombach2021highresolution}. This innovative approach results in a substantial reduction of computational requirements while still delivering high-fidelity outputs, thus making LDMs an attractive alternative for various generative tasks.

Following this initial framework, the LDM architecture has seen diverse applications, including the integration of retrieval-augmented methods that further bolster its generative capabilities. Notably, these models excel in generating images conditioned on textual prompts, indicative of their robustness in text-to-image synthesis. Stability AI’s advancements with their "Stable Diffusion" models leverage LDM frameworks to produce varied and high-quality outputs, illustrating the versatility of these models in creative applications \cite{stabilityai2023}.

Despite these advances, the deployment of LDMs is accompanied by significant challenges. Issues surrounding optimization during the sampling process remain, particularly in scaling the model without introducing artifacts or sacrificing the diversity of generated samples. Recent innovations, such as classifier-free guidance, have attempted to alleviate some of these issues by enabling the generation of more robust outputs while keeping the computational overhead manageable  \cite{blatmann2022}. However, the need for further improvements in the efficiency of the sampling process and in managing the diversity of outputs remains a prominent area for future research.

The connection to our proposed work lies in the exploitation of the latent representations within the LDM framework to not only enhance the quality of synthesis but also to address ongoing challenges in current generative models, particularly regarding optimization and the trade-offs associated with high-resolution outputs.
