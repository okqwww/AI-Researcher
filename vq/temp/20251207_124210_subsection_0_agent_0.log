\subsection{Variational Autoencoders and Discrete Representation Learning}
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling, particularly when learning discrete latent representations. One foundational paper in this domain, \cite{NEURIPS2017_1711.00937}, introduces the VQ-VAE architecture, which leverages vector quantization to create discrete embeddings. This approach not only facilitates better generative capabilities but also enhances interpretability by mapping continuous representations to a finite set of discrete codes.

Building upon this foundation, recent works have explored various extensions of VAEs. For instance, Edoardo Botta's work on Gaussian Mixture VAEs \cite{GaussianMixtureVAE} incorporates categorical latent variables, effectively capturing complex data distributions by modeling them as a mixture of Gaussians. This hierarchical generative process allows for greater flexibility in encoding diverse datasets, such as time series or images, into structured latent spaces.

In terms of technical innovations, the adoption of KL-divergence in optimization serves as a crucial mechanism for training VAEs. Furthermore, the Gumbel-softmax trick \cite{CategoricalReparameterization} addresses the non-differentiability associated with discrete variables, permitting gradient-based optimization. This technique approximates the categorical distribution during training, gradually refining the discrete representations over time.

Despite these advancements, challenges remain in the realm of optimization and interpretability of the latent space. Specifically, gradient-based updates can sometimes struggle with convergence, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional data or intricate mixtures. As a result, carefully tuning model parameters and employing appropriate training strategies is essential for achieving robust performance.

The relevance of these methodologies to the proposed work lies in their integration within diffusion models. By leveraging VQ-VAEs for effective representation learning, we aim to enhance the quality and diversity of generated outputs in our approach. This synergistic combination promises to capitalize on the strengths of both discrete representation learning and diffusion-based generation to address the evolving demands of generative modeling.
