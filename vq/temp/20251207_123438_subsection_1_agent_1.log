\subsection{Vector Quantizer}

The Vector Quantizer (VQ) is a critical component of our proposed architecture that facilitates the discretization of continuous latent representations into distinct embeddings. This discretization is essential for the construction of efficient, compressed representations, allowing the model to handle a finite number of embeddings effectively, thus promoting structured representation learning. The VQ operates by transforming latent vectors into embeddings using Exponential Moving Average (EMA) updates for codebook embeddings. This approach enhances training stability and improves gradient flow during backpropagation, making it particularly effective for training neural networks.

\subsubsection{Functionality}
During the forward pass of the Vector Quantizer, latent representations \(z_e\) are processed to yield quantized outputs \(z_q\), alongside quantization losses, denoted \(vq\_loss\), and relevant statistics, \(stats\). The transformation can be mathematically expressed as follows:

\begin{equation}
z_e \xrightarrow{\text{Quantizer}} z_q, \quad vq\_loss, \quad stats
\end{equation}

Where \(z_q\) denotes the quantized representation, \(vq\_loss\) encapsulates both the commitment loss and codebook loss—rules vital for stabilizing training. The \(stats\) include metrics such as perplexity and cluster utilization, providing insightful feedback on the quantization process.

\subsubsection{Embedding Updates}
The quantization mechanism maintains a dynamically updated codebook of embeddings, adjusted based on the frequency of embedding usage through EMA techniques. This updating strategy allows the embeddings to correspond closely to the underlying data distribution, ensuring that the codebook effectively captures relevant feature representations from the latent space. The embedding update process can be formalized as:

\begin{equation}
\text{Updated Embeddings} \leftarrow \text{EMA}(z_e, \text{encoding indices})
\end{equation}

This approach reinforces the importance of frequently used embeddings, augmenting their contribution to the model's overall performance while diminishing the influence of less utilized embeddings.

\subsubsection{RRT Gradient Transport}
To mitigate the challenges posed by the non-differentiable nature of quantization, we implement the Rotation-Rescaling Transformation (RRT) within our gradient transport strategy. This technique is vital for preserving angular relationships during gradient backpropagation from the quantized representations back to the encoder. Once \(z_q\) is generated, accompanying transformations are applied to the gradients, allowing effective backpropagation. This process can be represented as:

\begin{equation}
z_q \xrightarrow{\text{RRT}} \text{Transformed Gradients}
\end{equation}

The transformation employs a Householder reflection, ensuring that the gradients maintain their relevance and informational integrity regarding the corresponding codebook vectors. By preserving these angular representations, the VQ allows gradients to flow back to the encoder in a manner that is both meaningful and informative.

In conclusion, the Vector Quantizer plays a pivotal role in our framework not only by discretizing latent representations but also by enhancing the overall training dynamics through efficient embedding updates and sophisticated gradient transport methodologies. This ultimately leads to improved convergence rates and higher-quality representations within the VQ-VAE architecture.
