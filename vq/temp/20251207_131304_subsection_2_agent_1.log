\subsection{Generative Diffusion Models}
Generative diffusion models have garnered significant attention due to their effective capability in generating high-quality images from noise. A notable advancement in this field is the integration of natural language prompts into the diffusion process, referred to as text-guided synthesis, which enhances the controllability of the generated outputs. The seminal work "High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models" \cite{Rombach2021} introduced a novel architecture that combines diffusion processes with latent variable modeling, achieving state-of-the-art results in image synthesis. This approach allows the model to operate in a lower-dimensional latent space, significantly improving computational efficiency while maintaining generation quality.

A revolutionary technique that has proven beneficial for generative diffusion models is Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). This method enables more flexible image generation by leveraging classifier outputs without the need for an additional model, thereby reducing computational costs and simplifying the training process \cite{classifier_free_guidance}. Recent advancements have also prompted the exploration of more sophisticated sampling techniques to refine image quality and diversity, particularly in the context of multivariate conditional generation tasks.

The potential for integration with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) processes represents another promising avenue for enhancing diffusion models. By incorporating retrieval mechanisms, generative models could leverage external datasets to inform and enrich the generation process, leading to outputs that are not only higher in fidelity but also more contextually relevant \cite{retrieval_augmented_diffusion}.

Despite these advancements, challenges remain within the field. The high computational complexity and resource demands pose significant hurdles to the widespread application of these models. Furthermore, achieving a balance between preserving diversity in generated samples and minimizing artifacts during the sampling process continues to be an active area of research. 

The proposed work aims to build upon advancements in generative diffusion models by enhancing multivariate conditional generation, addressing these pressing challenges, and leveraging the discussed innovations to push the boundaries of generative model performance.
